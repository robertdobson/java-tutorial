      <h1>Basics of File I/O and Stream Objects</h1>

      <h2>Input/Ouput to and from files</h2>

      <ul>
      <li>File input and file output is an essential in         programming.
      <ul>
      <li>Most software involves more than keyboard input and screen user interfaces.</li>
      <li>Data needs to be stored somewhere when a program is not running, and that means writing data to disk.</li>
      <li>For this, we need file input and file output techniques.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <h3>Kinds of Files</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Formatted Text</b> vs. <b>Binary</b> files
 <ul>
 <li>A <i>text</i> file is simply made of readable text characters. It 
     looks like the output that is typically printed to the screen 
     through the <tt>cout</tt> object</li>

 <li>A <i>binary</i> file contains unformatted data, saved in its raw 
     memory format.  (For example, the integer 123456789 is saved as a 
     4-byte chunk of data, the same as it's stored in memory - NOT as the 
     9 digits in this sentence).</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Sequential</b> vs. <b>Random Access</b> files
 <ul>
 <li>A <i>sequential</i> file is one that is typically written or read 
     from start to finish</li>
 <li>A <i>random access</i> file is one that stores records, all of the 
     same size, and can read or write single records in place, without 
     affecting the rest of the file</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>(For now, we'll deal with sequential text files)</li>

</ul>
