         <h3>First things first! Basic directions for using this tutorial...</h3>
      </div>
      <ul>
         <li>Upon running the application, the Java Tutorial menu window will open in the center of the screen.</li>
         <li>Simply select one of the radio buttons along the left side to view a subject, and click the 'Explore' button.</li>
         <li>All subject selections will open the Document Viewer in the upper right corner of the screen to present lessons.</li>
         <li>The subject selections from Branching through Generics will also open a Code Demo graphical user interface (GUI) in the upper left corner of the screen to take input from the user and demonstrate the code examples in action.</li>
         <li>You can always close the Document Viewer or Code Demo GUI (using the X in the upper right corner of the respective window), and the main menu will remain open. If you want to explore another subject area, just select the corresponding radio button and click 'Explore'.</li>
         <li>You can completely exit the application by clicking the X in the upper right corner of the Java Tutorial menu window.</li>
         <li>NOTE: Sometimes the content being displayed in the Document Viewer will be larger than the window, and out of view. You can either use the scrollbar to view the information, or mouseover the edge of the window. When the mouse pointer changes to a bidirectional arrow, hold down the mouse button, and drag the window's edge to make the window larger.</li>
         <li>You can easily view and download all the source code and assets for this application. They are hosted on Github at this link: <a href="https://github.com/robertdobson/java-tutorial">https://github.com/robertdobson/java-tutorial</a></li>

      <h3>The main objectives and goals of this software:</h3>
      <p>My primary objective with designing and writing this application was to create a modular and adaptable piece of software with a focus on minimizing repetition of programming code. This software could easily be modified to present almost any subject, not just programming. Do I wish for it to be an approachable tutorial for beginners trying to learn programming? Absolutely! Do I think beginners can gain useful information for getting started with programming by using this application? Certainly! This entire application is a good learning experience beyond just the subject areas I explicity cover. The curious can learn about implementing GUIs, modular design structure, and some basic HTML, just to name a few extras, by examining the code under the hood of the entire project. My coverage of the tutorial subject matter isn't necessarily comprehensive, but again, my main purpose in writing this application is to create a modular and adaptable application with a focus on minimizing code repetition.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>A brief overview of this application's design and how it works...</h3>
      <p>The Java Tutorial application is composed of four classes:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The TutorialMenu class - This is the initial entry point for the application and serves the purpose of providing the central menu driver, from which a user can make a selection and explore various subjects.</li>
         <li>The DocumentViewer class - This class is primarily responsible for rendering and displaying the lesson documentation, which is written in HTML, via a JEditorPane.</li>
         <li>The CodeDemoGUI class - This class is responsible for providing the interactive GUI that takes user input and displays the results of running demonstrated code in a text area within the window.</li>
         <li>The CodeDemoMethods class - This class contains all the various methods called by the CodeDemoGUI for code demonstrations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>My design process...</h3>
      <p>I initially created a "basic skeleton" functioning console application that used a menu driver as an entry point, and called code methods to demonstrate that I'd previously written for college class assignments. However, I knew from the start that I wanted to end with a GUI application, as I consider that more approachable and easier to work with for novice computer users. So I designed the TutorialMenu class to provide a graphical menu interface.</p>
      <p>The next order of business was deciding how to deliver lesson documentation on demand that's relevant to the current subject and code being demonstrated, while using a single reusable window to display the information. Using a JEditorPane fits the bill here. When the user selects a radio button and clicks the 'Explore' button on the main menu, the TutorialMenu's actionPerformed method calls the runDocumentViewer method from the DocumentViewer class passing it String arguments for both the particular HTML document to be displayed, and the text to be displayed near the top of the JEditorPane border. The JEditorPane must have this information passed in before the GUI window is instantiated, or the result will be a blank page. The HTML documentation was researched from various internet resources and written by yours truly. I'd like to give a big shout out to <a href="http://hilite.me">hilite.me</a> for a quick and easy way to convert formatted programming code into HTML that displays nicely in the lesson documentation.</p>
      <p>After the DocumentViewer class was squared away, I began writing GUI classes to demonstrate the various code methods. I was almost finished with the third one when I stopped and said to myself, "Self...why are you creating a ton of repetitive code overhead by writing multiple code demonstration GUI classes? Silly rabbit!" At that point, I scrapped the three code demo classes I'd written, and designed the one-size-fits-all CodeDemoGUI class that calls and processes all the demonstrated code methods contained in the CodeDemoMethods class, on an as-needed basis. When the user's selected subject area from the TutorialMenu requires a code demonstration, the actionPerformed method calls the runCodeDemo method from the CodeDemoGUI class, and passes it two String arguments and four int arguments. The String arguments are <i>title</i> for window title, and <i>intro</i> for the brief instruction text presented on the CodeDemoGUI window. The int arguments are <i>start</i> for the spinner starting value, <i>min</i> for the spinner minimum value, <i>max</i> for the spinner maximum value, and <i>step</i> for the spinner increment change value. When the user clicks the button on the CodeDemoGUI window, the CodeDemoGUI's actionPerformed method calls the appropriate code demonstration method from the CodeDemoMethods class, which in turn processes the code and displays the output results in the CodeDemoGUI window's text area.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>A brief overview of some programming concepts...</h2>
      <p>I'm going to give a brief explanation of three fundamentals as a conclusion to the Introduction section:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Variables</li>
      	<li>Methods</li>
      	<li>Classes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What are variables and what do they do?</h3>
      <p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.</p>
      <p>Some common variable types:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li><i>byte</i> - a byte length integer</li>
      	<li><i>short</i> - a short integer</li>
      	<li><i>int</i> - integer</li>
      	<li><i>long</i> - a long integer</li>
      	<li><i>float</i> - single-precision floating point</li>
      	<li><i>double</i> - double-precision floating point</li>
      	<li><i>char</i> - a single character</li>
      	<li><i>boolean</i> - a boolean value(true or false)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can see an example of several variables declared at the top of the CodeDemoMethods class, and some of them are also initialized with a value.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What are methods?</h3>
      <p>A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name. Think of a method as a subprogram (or subroutine) that acts on data and often returns a value. Each method has its own name. There are many methods throughout the Java Tutorial application, but an easy to spot list of example methods can be found in the CodeDemoMethods class.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is a class?</h3>
      <p>Classes are blueprints describing attributes and behavior that you use to create objects while programming. In Object-Oriented languages, you'll work with a lot of classes already written, such as the Java Class Library. This availability enables you to create objects without also having to create the same classes repeatedly for each program. The Java Tutorial application has four classes that focus on four different main tasks.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>When should you create a separate class or method?</h3>
      <p>Some good rules for guidance on when and why:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Code reuse: When you have the same or very similar code in two places, it should be moved to a method.</li>
      	<li>Readibility: If a method spans more than a single page on screen, you may want to break it apart into several methods.</li>
      	<li>Focus: Every class or method should do only one specific task. Everything that is not core to this purpose should be delegated to other classes/methods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, try your very best to write code that is modular, reusable, readable, and maintainable, without writing a bunch of redundant code.</p>
